# AStar assignment - A routing problem

This is an assignment from the Optimisation subject at Master's in modelling for Science and Engineering in the UAB. 
Professor Lluís Alsedà (http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/MasterOpt/index.html).

The assignment consists in computing an optimal path (according to distance) from *Basílica de Santa
Maria del Mar* (Plaça de Santa Maria) in Barcelona to the *Giralda* (Calle Mateos Gago) in Sevilla by
using the `AStar` algorithm. To this end one has to implement the `AStar` algorithm (compulsory in form
of a function - not inside the main code) and compute and write the optimal path.

As the reference starting node for *Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar* (Plaça de Santa Maria) in
Barcelona we will take the node with key `(@id): 240949599` while the goal node close to *Giralda* (Calle
Mateos Gago) in Sevilla will be the node with key `(@id): 195977239`.

## Getting started
These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### Prerequisites
Depending on the native OS some external libraries will need to be included to run this program. See install section below.

This project supports the following C compiler versions:
* Apple gcc v4.2.1
* Ubuntu (16.4) gcc v5.4.0

Other regular C compilers should work as well but have not been tested yet.

For a graphical representation of the paths via Google Maps, Python 3 need to be installed and the following (additional) packages are required:
   * _requests_
  
### Installing on OSX
  
  
### Installing on Linux

To install the _requests_ python package do:
```
pip install requests
```
this require having installed pip:
```
sudo apt install python-pip
```

### Installing with Make

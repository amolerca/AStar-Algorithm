# AStar assignment - A routing problem

This is an assignment from the Optimisation subject at Master's in modelling for Science and Engineering in the UAB. 
Professor Lluís Alsedà (http://mat.uab.cat/~alseda/MasterOpt/index.html).

The assignment consists in computing an optimal path (according to distance) from *Basílica de Santa
Maria del Mar* (Plaça de Santa Maria) in Barcelona to the *Giralda* (Calle Mateos Gago) in Sevilla by
using the `AStar` algorithm. To this end one has to implement the `AStar` algorithm (compulsory in form
of a function - not inside the main code) and compute and write the optimal path.

As the reference starting node for *Basílica de Santa Maria del Mar* (Plaça de Santa Maria) in
Barcelona we will take the node with key `(@id): 240949599` while the goal node close to *Giralda* (Calle
Mateos Gago) in Sevilla will be the node with key `(@id): 195977239`.
